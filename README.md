# check-microcenter-raspberry-pi-zero

The [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-zero/) is a [hard to find](http://betanews.com/2016/02/15/how-to-find-and-buy-the-ever-elusive-5-raspberry-pi-zero/) $5.00 computer (as of March 20, 2016). Microcenter stores offer this version of the Pi but only in their retail stores and NOT online. Inventories for their various stores are available online. This little bash script uses curl to cycle through the stores (about 25) searching for Pi Zero's.

If you find this program useful, meaning you actually are able to purchase a Raspberry Pi Zero, then how about showing your appreciation by considering picking up an extra one for me? It's only a $5 contribution plus postage. Thanks!
