# check-microcenter-raspberry-pi-zero

The Raspberry Pi Zero is a hard to fidn $5.00 computer (as of March 20, 2016). Microcenter stores offer this version of the Pi but only in their retail stores and NOT online. Inventories for their various stores are available online.

If you find this program useful, meaning you actually are able to purchase a Raspberry Pi Zero, then how about showing your appreciation by considering picking up an extra one for me? It's only a $5 contribution plus postage. Thanks!
